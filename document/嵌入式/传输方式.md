## 串行传输 - Serial Transmission

As we know in Serial Transmission data is sent bit by bit, in such a way that each bit follows another. It is of two types namely, Synchronous and Asynchronous Transmission.
串行传输是等第一位数据传输完之后再传输下一位数据，串行传输有同步和异步两种传输方式。

One of the major differences is that in Synchronous Transmission, the sender and receiver should have synchronized clocks before data transmission. Whereas Asynchronous Transmission does not require a clock, but it adds a parity bit to the data before transmission.
其中一个主要区别是，在同步传输中，发送方和接收方在数据传输之前应具有同步时钟。而异步传输不需要时钟，而是在传输之前向数据添加奇偶校验位。

Furthermore, the synchronous transmission uses synchronization characters while asynchronous method employs start/stop bits, in order to alert the modem when data are being sent and when are these transmissions are completed are known as message characters.
此外，同步传输使用同步字符，而异步方法使用开始/停止位，以便在发送数据和当这些传输完成时向调制解调器发出警报。这些传输被称为消息字符。
